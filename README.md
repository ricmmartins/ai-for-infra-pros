# AI for Infra Pros
### The Artificial Intelligence Handbook for Infrastructure Professionals

---

## Overview

**AI for Infra Pros** is a technical and hands-on handbook for professionals from the **traditional infrastructure world** who want to understand — in practice — how **Artificial Intelligence connects to networking, compute, automation, and observability**.

This project is the meeting point between **Infra + AI**, bringing:
- Educational and applicable content (complete and organized chapters)
- **Real labs** to practice with Azure CLI, Terraform, Bicep, and AKS
- **Ready-to-use architectural diagrams**
- **Security and governance checklists**
- **Technical use cases** and an **adoption framework**
- A **visual glossary** to translate AI into infrastructure language

## Target Audience

Professionals in:

- Infrastructure and Cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP)  
- DevOps and SRE  
- Solutions Architecture  
- Security and Governance  
- Data Engineering professionals who want to understand the infrastructure side of AI
