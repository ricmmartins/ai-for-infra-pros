# Technical case studies: AI for infrastructure engineers

Real-world examples of how infrastructure professionals are already applying AI in production environments.  
Each scenario connects the theory from the chapters with hands-on impact and measurable outcomes.

## Case 1: Predicting failures with intelligent logs

**Scenario:**  
An infrastructure team managed hundreds of VMs and constantly received disk and CPU alerts, often too late to prevent downtime.

**Challenge:**  
Logs and metrics existed but provided no predictive signal — alerts only triggered after issues occurred.

**Solution:**  
- Collected logs and metrics using **Azure Monitor** + **Log Analytics**  
- Integrated **Azure Anomaly Detector API** to flag abnormal usage trends  
- Automated proactive alerts via **Azure Logic Apps**  

**Result:**  
✅ 30% reduction in critical incidents  
✅ Improved confidence from stakeholders  
✅ Infra team recognized as a predictive operations partner  

**Lesson:**  
You don’t need to be a data scientist to predict failures — prebuilt AI APIs + clean telemetry are enough to create value.

## Case 2: Building an internal copilot with Azure OpenAI

**Scenario:**  
A NOC team handled over 200 support tickets weekly — mostly repetitive troubleshooting requests and command lookups.

**Challenge:**  
Overload and slow response times, especially off-hours.

**Solution:**  
- Created an internal **Copilot** using **Azure OpenAI (GPT-4)**  
- Indexed internal documentation and logs  
- Connected via **Azure Function + Logic Apps + Microsoft Teams bot**

**Result:**  
✅ 40% reduction in L1 tickets  
✅ 24/7 self-service support  
✅ Improved satisfaction and response consistency  

**Lesson:**  
AI copilots are not just for developers — infrastructure teams can automate support and accelerate resolution.

## Case 3: Cost-efficient AI infrastructure for startups

**Scenario:**  
A startup wanted to deploy an image classification model trained elsewhere, but lacked GPU expertise and had a limited budget.

**Challenge:**  
- Small team, no MLOps experience  
- Need to run inference efficiently and securely  

**Solution:**  
- Deployed a **Standard_NCas_T4_v3** VM for GPU inference  
- Stored model files in **Azure Blob Storage**  
- Used **Bicep template** for repeatable deployment  
- Secured with **Azure AD** and IP firewall rules  

**Result:**  
✅ Total cost under **$150/month**  
✅ Latency under **300 ms**  
✅ Deployment in under 48 hours  

**Lesson:**  
With Infrastructure as Code and the right SKU, small teams can run production AI affordably.

## Case 4: Scaling GPU workloads with AKS and observability

**Scenario:**  
A multinational company ran on-prem GPU servers with local Python scripts — no scalability or monitoring.

**Challenge:**  
- Workloads couldn’t scale across clients  
- No fault tolerance or telemetry  

**Solution:**  
- Migrated to **AKS** with a dedicated GPU node pool  
- Containerized the model with **tolerations + GPU labels**  
- Added **DCGM Exporter + Prometheus + Grafana** dashboards  
- Enabled **autoscaling** based on GPU metrics and latency  

**Result:**  
✅ 99.9% uptime  
✅ 35% faster inference response time  
✅ Predictable cost and usage patterns  

**Lesson:**  
Container orchestration brings enterprise-grade reliability to AI workloads — even for legacy scripts.

## Case 5: Using AI to optimize infrastructure costs

**Scenario:**  
A SaaS DevOps team needed to cut costs and suspected their AKS cluster was over-provisioned.

**Challenge:**  
No visibility into real GPU and CPU utilization — decisions were guesswork.

**Solution:**  
- Combined **Prometheus metrics** with **Azure Cost Management API**  
- Trained a simple **linear regression model** in **Azure ML**  
- Built a dashboard showing “optimal vs. current” resource sizing  

**Result:**  
✅ 25% monthly savings on compute  
✅ Automated idle-node alerts  
✅ Data-driven capacity planning  

**Lesson:**  
Infrastructure + Data + AI = Smarter, measurable cloud efficiency.
