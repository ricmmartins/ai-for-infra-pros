# Chapter 1 — Foundations of AI for Infrastructure

> "You don’t need to be a data scientist to work with AI — but you do need to understand how it runs, scales, and is observed."

## 🧭 Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer just a buzzword — it’s a workload.  
And every workload needs **infrastructure**: compute, storage, networking, and observability.

This chapter introduces how infrastructure engineers, DevOps, and cloud architects can leverage their existing knowledge to build, run, and optimize AI environments — safely and efficiently.

## 🤖 What Is AI, Really?

AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence — recognizing patterns, making predictions, generating text, or answering questions.

In practice, AI is powered by **mathematical models** trained on large datasets.  
They learn statistical relationships between inputs and outputs, allowing them to make predictions or generate content.

Examples include:
- Classifying emails as spam or not spam  
- Predicting customer churn  
- Powering chatbots and copilots  
- Generating images or text with LLMs (Large Language Models)

## 🧱 The Three Building Blocks of Modern AI

Think of AI as a **digital factory** composed of three main layers:

| Layer | Role | Infrastructure Analogy |
|-------|------|--------------------------|
| **Data** | The raw material that feeds AI models | Storage — disks, databases, or data lakes |
| **Models** | The trained “brain” that processes data | Applications or engines |
| **Compute** | Where the processing happens | Servers, clusters, VMs, GPUs |

💡 If you understand these three layers, you already understand the foundation of AI.

## 🚂 Training vs Inference

| Stage | Description | Infrastructure View |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Training** | The process of teaching a model using historical data | High GPU demand, long-running jobs, heavy I/O |
| **Inference** | Using a trained model to generate predictions or responses | Real-time, scalable, latency-sensitive |

> You don’t always need to train models — most organizations only **host inference** in production.

In short:
- Training = Teaching  
- Inference = Applying what was learned

## 🧮 Tokens, Parameters, and Latency

In AI workloads, new metrics replace the traditional CPU and memory indicators.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| **Token** | A fragment of text (like a word or part of a word) processed by the model |
| **Parameter** | A numerical value that defines model behavior (e.g., GPT-4 has hundreds of billions) |
| **TPM (Tokens per Minute)** | The number of tokens a model can process per minute |
| **RPM (Requests per Minute)** | The number of API calls per minute |
| **Latency** | Time between sending an input and receiving the model’s response |
| **Context Length** | How much text (in tokens) the model can “remember” per call |

These metrics directly affect **cost**, **performance**, and **user experience**.

## ⚙️ Where Infrastructure Meets AI

AI workloads demand a combination of **compute, network, and observability excellence**.

| Infrastructure Area | Role in AI Workloads |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Compute** | GPUs for parallel workloads, CPU for preprocessing |
| **Networking** | Low-latency communication for real-time inference |
| **Storage** | Fast access to datasets and model checkpoints |
| **Automation (IaC)** | Environment reproducibility for training and inference |
| **Observability** | Monitoring GPU usage, token rates, and latency |
| **Security** | Protecting APIs, models, and datasets |

🔥 **Your infrastructure skills already apply** — just in a new context.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- AI workloads run **on top of the same infrastructure you already master**.  
- The difference lies in **scale, data intensity, and GPU usage**.  
- Focus on learning how AI consumes compute, storage, and networking resources.  
- Observability, security, and automation are just as critical as ever.
