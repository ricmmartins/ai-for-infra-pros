# Chapter 7 — AI use cases for infrastructure professionals

> “You don’t need to train a model to be part of the AI revolution. Infrastructure is the foundation that makes it all possible.”

## Why this matters

Many infrastructure professionals still see AI as a “data scientist’s domain.”  But in practice, **no AI project reaches production without a solid infrastructure foundation** — secure, observable, and automated.

If you understand **networking, compute, automation, monitoring, and security**, you already master about **70%** of what’s needed to operate AI at scale.  
What remains is simply knowing **where and how to apply it**.

## Natural areas of impact for infra + AI

| Area | Infrastructure professional contribution |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| **GPU provisioning** | Selecting SKUs, validating quotas, and scaling GPU clusters |
| **API security** | Access control, rate limiting, and abuse prevention |
| **Observability** | Logs, metrics, and tracing (GPU, TPM, RPM) |
| **Cost and efficiency** | Monitoring tokens, usage, and intelligent billing |
| **Automation and IaC** | Deploying clusters, models, and inference pipelines |
| **Networking and private access** | VNets, Private Endpoints, NSGs, and secure isolation |
| **High availability** | Readiness probes, replication, and regional failover |
| **DevOps integration** | GitHub Actions, CI/CD, and model promotion between environments |


## 📘 Use Case 1 — Predicting disk and server failures

**Problem:** Servers fail unexpectedly; disks die without warning.  
**AI Solution:**

- Collect metrics for CPU, disk, temperature, and event logs.  
- Train predictive models (regression, decision trees, or AutoML).  
- Trigger alerts before failures occur.

**Tools:** Azure Monitor • Log Analytics • Azure ML • AutoML • Prophet  
💡 **Insight:** Your experience in metrics and alerts is already the first step toward predictive failure models.

## 📘 Use Case 2 — Anomaly detection in logs and metrics

**Problem:** How do you spot one failure among millions of log lines?  
**AI Solution:**

- Detect abnormal patterns using anomaly detection models.  
- Classify logs by severity and context.  
- Use LLMs to generate automatic incident summaries.

**Tools:** Azure Anomaly Detector • Kusto Query Language (KQL) + ML • Azure OpenAI (GPT-4)  
💬 “AI doesn’t replace the SRE — it amplifies their vision.”


## 📘 Use Case 3 — AI as an operations copilot (ChatOps + LLMs)

**Problem:** Teams spend too much time parsing alerts, tickets, and scattered technical documentation.  
**AI Solution:**

- Internal Copilot that answers questions and suggests actions.  
- Chatbot integrated with Teams or Slack accessing logs and metrics.  
- Incident interpretation through natural language.

**Tools:** Azure OpenAI • Azure Functions • Teams/Slack Bots • DevOps Pipelines + Prompts  
💡 **Example:**  
“Copilot, show the last 10 failures in the AKS WestUS3 cluster and GPU usage above 80%.”

## 📘 Use Case 4 — Automated incident response

**Problem:** SRE teams overloaded with repetitive incidents.  
**AI Solution:**

- Automatically classify incidents via supervised models.  
- Trigger automatic playbooks (e.g., restart, scale-out, failover).  
- Continuously learn from historical ticket data.

**Tools:** Azure ML • Logic Apps • GitHub Copilot • Power Automate  
**Example:** Failure detected → Model classifies → Logic App fixes → Message sent to Teams.


## 📘 Use Case 5 — Infrastructure and cost optimization

**Problem:** Overprovisioned resources or idle VMs waste money.  
**AI Solution:**

- Models that recommend automatic resizing.  
- Cost forecasting based on usage history and growth.  
- VM type recommendations optimized for workload efficiency.

**Tools:** Azure Advisor • Cost Management • Power BI • Custom ML Models  
💡 **Tip:** Combine **AI + FinOps** for automated cost-saving recommendations.

## 📘 Use Case 6 — Intelligent monitoring of hybrid environments

**Problem:** Multi-cloud and on-prem environments cause fragmented visibility.  
**AI Solution:**

- LLM reads alerts from multiple sources and generates automatic reports.  
- Detect anomalies across hybrid pipelines.  
- Generate daily status summaries via GPT.

**Tools:** Azure Arc • Azure OpenAI • Grafana API • Zabbix/Nagios Integration  
**Insight:** AI can act as your 24x7 junior analyst — filtering noise and surfacing what matters.

## 📘 Use Case 7 — AI architectures for startups and small teams

**Scenario:** Startups want to adopt AI but lack GPU, networking, or cost expertise.  
**Solution:**

- Build cost-efficient architecture with GPU VMs + Blob + Private Networking.  
- Provision reproducible environments using Terraform or Bicep.  
- Automate inference deployment with GitHub Actions.  

**Result:** You become the **AI Infra Partner**, enabling AI securely and efficiently.

## Advanced scenarios (for those who want to go further)

| Case | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Edge AI for IoT** | Train and deploy detection models on physical devices. |
| **Observable infra with GPT** | Query metrics and logs via prompts (“show network failures from the last 2 hours”). |
| **Automatic ticket classification** | Use LLMs and embeddings to group similar incidents. |
| **Infra-as-Agent** | Autonomous agents that provision, test, and validate resources based on policy. |


## Career paths and specializations

| Role | Main focus |
|-------|-------------|
| **AI Infrastructure Engineer** | GPU, AKS, performance, and scalability |
| **MLOps Engineer** | Model deployment, monitoring, and automation |
| **AI Cloud Architect** | End-to-end architecture with Azure and OpenAI |
| **AI Platform Engineer** | Internal platforms for Data Science teams |
| **FinOps for AI** | Cost, performance, and optimization of inference workloads |

## 💡 Final reflection

> “The intersection between infrastructure and AI is the most promising area in technology today.”

You don’t need to wait for the data team to apply AI.  You can be the starting point — and the **enabler** who makes the impossible scalable.

## Conclusion

AI is a new demand layer built on top of what you already master: **Compute, Networking, Storage, Security, and Automation.**

With Azure expertise and a curious mindset, you can:

- Predict failures before they happen  
- Automate incidents  
- Reduce costs  
- Increase availability  
- Enable entire teams to innovate with confidence  

The future of AI needs those who understand infrastructure and **that professional can be you.**
