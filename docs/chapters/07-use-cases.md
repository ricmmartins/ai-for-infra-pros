# Chapter 7 ‚Äî AI Use Cases for Infrastructure Professionals

> ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to train a model to be part of the AI revolution. Infrastructure is the foundation that makes it all possible.‚Äù

## üéØ Why This Matters

Many infrastructure professionals still see AI as a ‚Äúdata scientist‚Äôs domain.‚Äù  
But in practice, **no AI project reaches production without a solid infrastructure foundation** ‚Äî secure, observable, and automated.

If you understand **networking, compute, automation, monitoring, and security**, you already master about **70%** of what‚Äôs needed to operate AI at scale.  
What remains is simply knowing **where and how to apply it**.

## üìò Use Case 1 ‚Äî Predicting Disk and Server Failures

**Problem:** Servers fail unexpectedly; disks die without warning.  
**AI Solution:**

- Collect metrics for CPU, disk, temperature, and event logs.  
- Train predictive models (regression, decision trees, or AutoML).  
- Trigger alerts before failures occur.

**Tools:** Azure Monitor ‚Ä¢ Log Analytics ‚Ä¢ Azure ML ‚Ä¢ AutoML ‚Ä¢ Prophet  
üí° **Insight:** Your experience in metrics and alerts is already the first step toward predictive failure models.

## üìò Use Case 2 ‚Äî Anomaly Detection in Logs and Metrics

**Problem:** How do you spot one failure among millions of log lines?  
**AI Solution:**

- Detect abnormal patterns using anomaly detection models.  
- Classify logs by severity and context.  
- Use LLMs to generate automatic incident summaries.

**Tools:** Azure Anomaly Detector ‚Ä¢ Kusto Query Language (KQL) + ML ‚Ä¢ Azure OpenAI (GPT-4)  
üí¨ ‚ÄúAI doesn‚Äôt replace the SRE ‚Äî it amplifies their vision.‚Äù

---

## üìò Use Case 3 ‚Äî AI as an Operations Copilot (ChatOps + LLMs)

**Problem:** Teams spend too much time parsing alerts, tickets, and scattered technical documentation.  
**AI Solution:**

- Internal Copilot that answers questions and suggests actions.  
- Chatbot integrated with Teams or Slack accessing logs and metrics.  
- Incident interpretation through natural language.

**Tools:** Azure OpenAI ‚Ä¢ Azure Functions ‚Ä¢ Teams/Slack Bots ‚Ä¢ DevOps Pipelines + Prompts  
üí° **Example:**  
‚ÄúCopilot, show the last 10 failures in the AKS WestUS3 cluster and GPU usage above 80%.‚Äù

---

## üìò Use Case 4 ‚Äî Automated Incident Response

**Problem:** SRE teams overloaded with repetitive incidents.  
**AI Solution:**

- Automatically classify incidents via supervised models.  
- Trigger automatic playbooks (e.g., restart, scale-out, failover).  
- Continuously learn from historical ticket data.

**Tools:** Azure ML ‚Ä¢ Logic Apps ‚Ä¢ GitHub Copilot ‚Ä¢ Power Automate  
‚öôÔ∏è **Example:** Failure detected ‚Üí Model classifies ‚Üí Logic App fixes ‚Üí Message sent to Teams.

---

## üìò Use Case 5 ‚Äî Infrastructure and Cost Optimization

**Problem:** Overprovisioned resources or idle VMs waste money.  
**AI Solution:**

- Models that recommend automatic resizing.  
- Cost forecasting based on usage history and growth.  
- VM type recommendations optimized for workload efficiency.

**Tools:** Azure Advisor ‚Ä¢ Cost Management ‚Ä¢ Power BI ‚Ä¢ Custom ML Models  
üí° **Tip:** Combine **AI + FinOps** for automated cost-saving recommendations.

---

## üìò Use Case 6 ‚Äî Intelligent Monitoring of Hybrid Environments

**Problem:** Multi-cloud and on-prem environments cause fragmented visibility.  
**AI Solution:**

- LLM reads alerts from multiple sources and generates automatic reports.  
- Detect anomalies across hybrid pipelines.  
- Generate daily status summaries via GPT.

**Tools:** Azure Arc ‚Ä¢ Azure OpenAI ‚Ä¢ Grafana API ‚Ä¢ Zabbix/Nagios Integration  
üß† **Insight:** AI can act as your 24x7 junior analyst ‚Äî filtering noise and surfacing what matters.

---

## üìò Use Case 7 ‚Äî AI Architectures for Startups and Small Teams

**Scenario:** Startups want to adopt AI but lack GPU, networking, or cost expertise.  
**Solution:**

- Build cost-efficient architecture with GPU VMs + Blob + Private Networking.  
- Provision reproducible environments using Terraform or Bicep.  
- Automate inference deployment with GitHub Actions.  

‚öôÔ∏è **Result:** You become the **AI Infra Partner**, enabling AI securely and efficiently.
