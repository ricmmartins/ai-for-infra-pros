# Chapter 7 — AI Use Cases for Infrastructure Professionals

> “You don’t have to be a data scientist to deliver AI value. Infrastructure is where AI comes to life.”

## 🎯 Why This Matters

If you work in infrastructure, you already handle:
- Logs, metrics, and alerts  
- Provisioning and automation  
- Networking, security, and uptime  
- Distributed environments  

All of these are fuel for AI.  
This chapter shows **how infrastructure expertise can directly enable AI**, through real-world and practical examples.

## 📘 Use Case 1 — Predicting Failures in Servers and Disks

**Problem:** Servers fail “randomly” — disks crash, clusters go offline.  
**AI Solution:**
- Collect CPU, memory, disk I/O, and temperature metrics.  
- Train a predictive model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree).  
- Generate early-warning alerts before hardware failure.

**Azure Tools:**
- Azure Monitor + Log Analytics  
- Azure Machine Learning + AutoML  
- Time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet)

---

## 📘 Use Case 2 — Detecting Anomalies in Logs and Metrics

**Problem:** How do you find one issue among 10,000 log lines?  
**AI Solution:**
- Use ML to detect unusual spikes, anomalies, and rare messages.  
- Automatically classify logs by severity and context.  
- Apply unsupervised clustering to group similar events.

**Azure Tools:**
- Azure Anomaly Detector API  
- Kusto Query Language (KQL) with ML plugins  
- GPT-based natural language log analysis

## 📘 Use Case 3 — ChatOps and AI Copilots for Operations

**Problem:** Documentation is scattered; support is slow.  
**AI Solution:**
- Internal AI Copilot that interprets logs, answers technical questions.  
- Context-aware assistants that suggest actions or CLI commands.  
- Chatbots integrated into Teams or Slack with access to monitoring data.

**Azure Tools:**
- Azure OpenAI (GPT models)  
- Azure Functions + Logic Apps  
- Azure DevOps Pipelines or API triggers

---

## 📘 Use Case 4 — Automating Incident Response

**Problem:** The SRE team is overwhelmed with repetitive incidents.  
**AI Solution:**
- Train a classifier to categorize incidents by root cause.  
- Automate responses for known issues.  
- Generate playbooks dynamically using AI suggestions.

**Azure Tools:**
- Azure Machine Learning  
- Azure Logic Apps  
- GitHub Actions + Copilot  
- Power Automate

---

## 📘 Use Case 5 — Cost and Resource Optimization with AI

**Problem:** Over-provisioned VMs, idle clusters, and expensive GPUs.  
**AI Solution:**
- Build models to recommend optimal resource scaling.  
- Forecast future costs based on usage patterns.  
- Suggest VM SKUs or autoscale configurations dynamically.

**Azure Tools:**
- Azure Advisor  
- Azure Cost Management + Power BI  
- Custom ML models with billing datasets  

---

## 📘 Use Case 6 — Unified Monitoring for Hybrid Environments

**Problem:** Multicloud and on-prem environments produce fragmented visibility.  
**AI Solution:**
- LLM summarizes alerts across clouds and tools.  
- Automated status reports and incident summaries.  
- Log and metric correlation via embeddings and semantic search.

**Azure Tools:**
- Azure Arc  
- Azure OpenAI (RAG for monitoring)  
- APIs for Zabbix, Grafana, and Prometheus integrations

---

## 📘 Use Case 7 — Infrastructure for AI Startups

**Scenario:** A small company wants to deploy an AI model but lacks infra knowledge.  
**Your Role:**
- Design cost-efficient architecture (GPU VM + Blob + Private Networking).  
- Deploy via Bicep or Terraform.  
- Automate endpoint creation and scaling.

**You Become:**  
The **technical enabler** that makes AI adoption possible, safely and efficiently.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- Infrastructure isn’t secondary — it’s the backbone of AI.  
- You can start small: monitor, automate, or optimize.  
- Every AI project needs **network, compute, storage, and observability** — your expertise.
