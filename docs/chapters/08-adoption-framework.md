# Chapter 8 — AI Adoption Framework for Infrastructure

> “You don’t need to be a data scientist to architect AI — but you do need a plan that speaks the language of infrastructure.”

---

## 🧭 Overview

The **AI Adoption Framework for Infrastructure** is a technical and strategic guide that helps infrastructure professionals **plan, prepare, and operate AI workloads** with security, efficiency, and governance.

Inspired by Microsoft’s **Cloud Adoption Framework**, this model translates the AI journey into the infrastructure domain — focusing on **automation, scalability, and continuous operation**.

---

## 🚀 Framework Structure

The framework consists of **6 phases**, each with clear goals, practical activities, and recommended tools.

```

## 🧩 Phase 1 — Diagnostic and Technical Motivation

📌 **Goal:** Understand the *why* of AI and the role of infrastructure in the process.

| Activity | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Identify opportunities | Review operational pain points, bottlenecks, and automation gaps |
| Map stakeholders | Data, DevOps, security, and business teams |
| Assess maturity | Is current infra automated? Observable? GPU-ready? |
| Begin enablement | Complete AI-900 and read this eBook |

🔧 **Useful Tools:**

- Technical Maturity Assessment Sheet (Infra + AI)  
- Azure OpenAI Quota Viewer  
- Technical Readiness Form  

💡 **Ask yourself:** “If I needed to run an AI model tomorrow, would my infrastructure be ready?”

---

## 🎓 Phase 2 — Enablement and Technical Alignment

📌 **Goal:** Level technical understanding and create a shared knowledge foundation.

| Activity | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Upskill the infra team | Workshops, labs, and guided reading per chapter |
| Translate AI concepts | Inference, GPU, fine-tuning, tokens, quotas |
| Build a knowledge base | Visual glossary, cheat sheets, mini-labs |
| Promote hands-on sessions | Experimentation with scripts and templates |

🔧 **Suggested Resources:**

- eBook Labs  
- AI-900 • Azure AI Fundamentals  
- Visual Technical Glossary  
- Initial Script Pack (Azure CLI, Terraform, Bicep)

---

## 🏗️ Phase 3 — Infrastructure Preparation

📌 **Goal:** Provision the foundational building blocks for AI workloads.

| Component | Recommended Actions |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Networking** | Create VNet, subnets, Private Endpoints, NSGs, internal DNS |
| **Compute** | Deploy GPU VMs, AKS GPU node pools, AML Workspaces |
| **Storage** | Blob, Data Lake, local NVMe |
| **Automation** | IaC (Terraform/Bicep), GitHub Actions |
| **Observability** | Azure Monitor, Prometheus, Application Insights |

🔧 **eBook Templates:**

- `bicep/vm-gpu.bicep` — GPU VM with NVMe  
- `terraform/aks-gpu.tf` — AKS cluster with GPU pool  
- `yaml/inference-api.yaml` — Inference API with health checks  

💬 **Reminder:** “You don’t scale AI with spreadsheets. You scale it with code.”

---

## 🧠 Phase 4 — Guided Experimentation and Initial Use Cases

📌 **Goal:** Validate real-world scenarios and build technical confidence.

| Activity | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Run pilots | Intelligent logging, copilots, GPT-based alerts |
| Build inference APIs | Deploy in AKS, AML, or Azure Functions |
| Validate security | Test RBAC, prompt injection, and isolation |
| Document learnings | Capture results and best practices |

🔧 **Suggested Starter Use Cases:**

- Monitoring with LLM + Prometheus  
- AI-driven log and alert analysis  
- ChatOps (internal GPT-based copilots)  
- Inference pipeline with automated rollback  

---

## 🧱 Phase 5 — Scale, Governance, and Resilience

📌 **Goal:** Standardize, secure, and sustain AI workloads in production.

| Area | Recommended Actions |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Standardization** | Centralized IaC templates, tagging, and conventions |
| **Costs** | Azure Cost Management, budgets, GPU quotas |
| **Security** | Key Vault, RBAC, federated identity |
| **Resilience** | Availability Zones, backups, HA via Front Door |
| **Observability** | Latency, tokens, GPU usage, 429s, cost per model |

🔧 **Tools:**

- Application Insights + Log Analytics  
- Azure Policy + Defender for Cloud  
- Grafana (GPU metrics via DCGM)  
- Autoscaling templates for inference workloads  

---

## 🔄 Phase 6 — Continuous Adoption and Feedback

📌 **Goal:** Integrate AI sustainably into the infrastructure lifecycle.

| Activity | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Continuous review | Post-mortems with AI and evolving dashboards |
| Learning culture | Internal wiki and “Infra + AI” Teams channels |
| Continuous improvement | A/B testing models, integrating Vector DBs |
| Impact measurement | KPIs: MTTR, avoided incidents, reduced cost |

💡 **Tip:** AI isn’t a project — it’s a process. Establish learning and feedback cadence.

## 🧩 Framework Summary

| Phase | Key Deliverable | Core Tools |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **Diagnostic** | Technical readiness plan | Excel, Quota Viewer |
| **Enablement** | Shared technical knowledge base | AI-900, Labs |
| **Preparation** | Secure GPU-enabled IaC environments | Terraform, Bicep |
| **Experimentation** | Use cases and inference APIs | Azure ML, AKS |
| **Scale** | Standardization, observability, and HA | Cost Mgmt, Prometheus |
| **Continuous Adoption** | Governance and improvement loops | Dashboards, Feedback Loops |

## 📘 Practical Applications of the Framework

This framework can be used as:

- ✅ **Infrastructure Maturity Checklist** for technical teams  
- 🧭 **Adoption roadmap** for Azure OpenAI, AML, and AKS  
- 📑 **Onboarding guide** for new infrastructure team members  
- 🔄 **Rollout plan** for GPU and distributed inference environments  

✅ **Direct Benefit:** Transforms AI from an “experimental concept” into an **operational, scalable, and governed practice.**

---

## ✅ Chapter Conclusion

You now have a complete technical roadmap to lead AI adoption within your organization — starting from what you already know best: **infrastructure**.

> “AI adoption isn’t just the responsibility of data teams.  
> It’s the responsibility of those who build the foundation. And that person is you.”
