# Chapter 8 — AI Adoption Framework for Infrastructure

> “You don’t need to be a data scientist to architect AI — but you do need a plan that speaks the language of infrastructure.”

---

## 🧭 Overview

Inspired by the [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/), the **AI Adoption Framework for Infrastructure** provides a practical guide for technical teams to design, scale, and operate AI workloads safely, efficiently, and with governance in mind.

This framework defines **six clear phases**, each with goals, responsibilities, and technical checklists to help infrastructure engineers lead AI adoption confidently.

---

## 🚀 Phase 1 — Discovery and Technical Motivation

**Goal:** Understand *why* and *where* AI fits in your infrastructure.

| Objective | Recommended Actions |
|------------|----------------------|
| Identify opportunities | Review operational pain points: performance, cost, and automation gaps. |
| Map stakeholders | Engage data, DevOps, SRE, and security teams early. |
| Assess infra maturity | Evaluate automation level, observability, GPU availability, and readiness. |
| Start upskilling | Read this handbook, take **AI-900**, and experiment with the provided labs. |

**Useful Tools:**  
- Technical Readiness Assessment Form  
- Infrastructure + AI Maturity Worksheet  

---

## 🧠 Phase 2 — Enablement and Technical Alignment

**Goal:** Build foundational knowledge and align infra with AI workloads.

| Objective | Recommended Actions |
|------------|----------------------|
| Train the infra team | Host workshops and labs focused on AI architecture and deployment. |
| Translate AI concepts | Explain inference, training, tokens, and compute consumption. |
| Create shared knowledge base | Glossary, cheat sheets, FAQs, and architecture blueprints. |

**Useful Resources:**  
- Labs in this handbook  
- Glossary Visual  
- Microsoft Learn: AI Fundamentals (AI-900)  

---

## 🏗️ Phase 3 — Infrastructure Preparation

**Goal:** Provision the required environments for AI workloads.

| Objective | Recommended Actions |
|------------|----------------------|
| Network and access | Configure VNets, NSGs, Private Endpoints, Key Vault, and RBAC. |
| Compute | Deploy GPU-based VMs, AKS clusters, or Azure ML workspaces. |
| Automation | Implement IaC with Terraform or Bicep; integrate GitHub Actions. |
| Observability | Set up Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and Prometheus. |

**Included Templates:**  
- `bicep-vm-gpu/main.bicep`  
- `terraform-aks-gpu/main.tf`  
- `yaml-inference-api/deploy.yaml`  

---

## 🔬 Phase 4 — Guided Experimentation and Initial Use Cases

**Goal:** Execute pilot projects with measurable results.

| Objective | Recommended Actions |
|------------|----------------------|
| Deploy first AI workloads | Test log analysis, AI copilots, and anomaly detection. |
| Publish inference APIs | Use Azure ML, AKS, or Function Apps. |
| Validate pipelines and security | Perform prompt-injection testing, enforce RBAC, and isolate workspaces. |

**Recommended Use Cases:**  
- AI-assisted monitoring with LLMs  
- Log and alert classification  
- Internal ChatOps copilots  
- Inference pipelines with rollback policies  

---

## 🏢 Phase 5 — Scale, Governance, and Resilience

**Goal:** Standardize, secure, and sustain AI infrastructure at scale.

| Objective | Recommended Actions |
|------------|----------------------|
| Standardize deployments | Centralized IaC modules, naming conventions, and tagging. |
| Control cost and access | Budgets, Key Vault, Azure Policy, and federated identity. |
| Ensure resilience | Multi-zone deployments, backups, and autoscaling with GPU metrics. |
| Monitor production | Track latency, GPU usage, inference success rate, and cost. |

**Key Tools:**  
- Azure Cost Management  
- Azure Defender for Cloud  
- Application Insights + Log Analytics  
- GPU Autoscale Templates  

---

## 🔁 Phase 6 — Continuous Adoption and Feedback

**Goal:** Make AI part of everyday infrastructure operations.

| Objective | Recommended Actions |
|------------|----------------------|
| Establish review culture | Run AI-driven postmortems and evolution dashboards. |
| Document and share | Internal wikis, architecture guides, and reusable playbooks. |
| Continuously evolve | A/B test new models and integrate advanced components (e.g., vector databases). |

**Suggestions:**  
- Create an internal “Infra + AI” channel.  
- Host bi-weekly knowledge-sharing sessions.  
- Track KPIs (MTTR, incidents reduced, GPU utilization).  

---

## 🧩 Practical Uses of This Framework

This framework can serve as:
- A **maturity checklist** for infra teams adopting AI  
- A **project guide** for new AI initiatives  
- A **technical onboarding reference** for hybrid AI projects  
- A **communication bridge** between infra and data teams  

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

You now have a **strategic and actionable map** to lead or support AI adoption from an infrastructure perspective.  
AI success isn’t owned by data teams alone — it’s powered by the foundation that infrastructure engineers build.

> “AI needs infrastructure. And infrastructure needs to understand AI.”
